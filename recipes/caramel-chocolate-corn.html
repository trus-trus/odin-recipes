    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
        Once, on a trip through Wisconsin, we stopped at an outlet mall, and I went into a Harry and David store. They had bags upon bags of this amazing-looking chocolate and caramel popcorn. It looked great, but there was no way I would pay $7 for a bag of something I could easily make at home.

    <p>
        Once we got home, I set to work on this equally delicious (and much more frugal) version as a treat for my family. It turned out so yummy and pretty that I thought it would make a great gift for a teacher or friend. It would also be a good addition to any birthday or holiday party. Everyone loves it!
